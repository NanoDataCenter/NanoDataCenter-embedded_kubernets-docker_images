PIEXIL is an XML FORMAT

XML tree format of nodes

Basic Nodes are simply nodes  

Extended Nodes are the working nodes which compile to basic nodes.

There are 8 extended nodes

1. Concurrent -- Node has a list of subnodes.  All sub nodes are spawned for execution.  Node ends execution when all the sub nodes terminate
2. Unchecked Sequence -- Node has a list of sub nodes.  Each subnodes are run in order with no checking for execution
3. Checked Sequence  -- Similar to 2 except if an error in a subnode will result in stoping sequence processes.
4. Try -- Node has a list of sub nodes.  Each subnodes are run in order till a node succeeds.  Execution stops when a subnode succeeds  
5. IF_THEN_ESLE_ELSEIF is a logic statement with each succeeding branch having a list of nodes to run
6. While and DO_WHILE  a node to test loop termination and a node for execution
7. For similar for c type for

--- communication with external systems
8  On_message
9. On Command
10. Synchrounos 

11. Wait -- time delay


A node has 8 conditions
1. Start Condition
2. End condition
3. Repeat Condition
4. Skip Condition

Failure Conditions

5. Preconditons
6. Post Conditions
7. Invariant Conditons  -- condition is checked while node is executing.
8. Exit Conditions
